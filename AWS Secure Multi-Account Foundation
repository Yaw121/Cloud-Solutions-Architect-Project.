Overview

This project builds a secure AWS multi-account foundation similar to what a Cloud Security Engineer would design for a small organization:

Centralized logging with organization CloudTrail

Multi-account structure with OUs

SCPs to prevent dangerous actions

Org-level GuardDuty, Security Hub, and AWS Config
