# Cloud-Solutions-Architect-Project.


The objective of this project is to design, build, and secure a complete AWS cloud environment by following a structured 14-module learning path (M1–M14).

The labs demonstrate hands-on expertise in identity and access management, secure networking, encrypted storage, hardened compute, monitoring and threat detection, serverless security, automation, DevOps pipelines, container security, and disaster recovery. 

Each module results in a working implementation with least-privilege access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, automated monitoring, and compliance guardrails, documented in 
GitHub with step-by-step guides, architecture diagrams, runbooks, and security policies. The end goal is to showcase the ability to operate as a Cloud Security Engineer who can architect, secure, and monitor workloads on AWS while aligning with best practices and cost-efficient designs.

        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::org-cloudtrail-logs-ACCOUNT_ID",
        "arn:aws:s3:::org-cloudtrail-logs-ACCOUNT_ID/*"
      ]
