# Cloud-Solutions-Architect-Project.


The objective of this project is to design, build, and secure a complete AWS cloud environment by following a structured 14-module learning path (M1–M14).

The labs demonstrate hands-on expertise in identity and access management, secure networking, encrypted storage, hardened compute, monitoring and threat detection, serverless security, automation, DevOps pipelines, container security, and disaster recovery. 

Each module results in a working implementation with least-privilege access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, automated monitoring, and compliance guardrails, documented in 
GitHub with step-by-step guides, architecture diagrams, runbooks, and security policies. The end goal is to showcase the ability to operate as a Cloud Security Engineer who can architect, secure, and monitor workloads on AWS while aligning with best practices and cost-efficient designs.

  <summary><b>🔹 M1 — Identity & Access Management (IAM)</b></summary>
  
### Goal: 
Apply least-privilege access and enforce MFA through IAM users, groups, roles, and custom policies. Builds the foundation for secure access control in AWS.

## Step 1: Open the IAM Dashboard
- Sign in as your admin IAM user (not root).
- In the search bar, type IAM → open the IAM service.

## Step 2: Create a User Group
- In the left menu → User groups → Create group.
- Name: ReadOnlyGroup.
- Attach policy: check ReadOnlyAccess.
- Click Create group.

## Step 3: Create a User
- Left menu → Users → Add users.
- User name: analyst.
- Provide user access to the AWS Management Console.
- Set a password (autogenerated or custom).
- Next → Add user to group → choose ReadOnlyGroup.
- Skip tags → Create user.

## Step 4: Enforce MFA for User
- In the Users list → click analyst.
- Go to Security credentials tab.
- Assign MFA device → choose Authenticator app.
- Scan QR code with an app (Google Authenticator/Authy) → enter the 2 codes.
- MFA now shows as Assigned.

## Step 5: Create a Custom Policy
- IAM → Policies → Create policy.
- Choose JSON editor.
- Paste (replace ACCOUNT_ID with yours)
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::org-cloudtrail-logs-ACCOUNT_ID",
        "arn:aws:s3:::org-cloudtrail-logs-ACCOUNT_ID/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

- Name: S3LogsReadPolicy.
- Create policy.

## Step 6: Attach Custom Policy
- IAM → Users → click analyst.
- Permissions → Add permissions → Attach policies directly.
- Search S3LogsReadPolicy → select it → Add permissions.

## Step 7: Create an IAM Role for EC2
- IAM → Roles → Create role.
- Trusted entity: AWS service → EC2.
- Permissions: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore.
- Role name: EC2-SSM-Role.
- Create role.

Step 8: Test User Permissions
- Sign out → log in as analyst.
- Try S3:
  - You can list the CloudTrail logs bucket.
  - Try uploading → should be Access Denied.
- Try creating an EC2 → should also be Access Denied.

 - Access to create an EC2 instance denied

- Access to create a Bucket denied

<summary><b>M2-  STORAGE SERVEICES (S3)</b></summary>

### Objective
Secure object storage with encryption, versioning, lifecycle management, logging, and private access via CloudFront.

### 1: Create main bucket

  - S3 → Create bucket → name: New-cloudlab

  - Region: same as other labs.

  - Enable: Block all public access, Bucket versioning, Default encryption (AWS-KMS).

### 2: Create log bucket

   - S3 → Create bucket → name:  New-cloudlab

   - Enable server access logging

   - Open main bucket → Properties → Server access logging → enable, target bucket =  New-cloudlab.

 ### 3: Add lifecycle rule

   - Management → Lifecycle → create rule “ExpireOldVersions” → permanently delete noncurrent versions after 30 days.

### 5: Static website (via CloudFront)

   - Upload index.html to main bucket.

   - CloudFront → Create distribution → Origin = main bucket → enable OAC.

   - Block public access on bucket; CloudFront updates bucket policy.

   - Public access blocked

<summary><b>🔹 M3 — Networking (VPC)</b></summary>

### Goal: 
Build secure VPC with endpoints & private DNS.


### 1: VPC → Create VPC wizard → “VPC with public and private subnets”.

### 2: Add one NAT Gateway for private subnets.

### 3: VPC → Endpoints:

   - Add gateway endpoints for S3, DynamoDB.

   - Add interface endpoints for SSM, EC2Messages, CloudWatch Logs.

### 4: Route 53 → Private Hosted Zone corp.local.

   - Add app.corp.local A record → private instance IP.

### Verify:

   - EC2 in private subnet can reach S3 without internet.

   - Private hosted zone resolves from inside VPC only.
