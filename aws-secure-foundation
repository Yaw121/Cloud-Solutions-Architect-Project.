Overview

This project builds a secure AWS multi-account foundation similar to what a Cloud Security Engineer would design for a small organization:

Centralized logging with organization CloudTrail

Multi-account structure with OUs

SCPs to prevent dangerous actions

Org-level GuardDuty, Security Hub, and AWS Config


STEPS

Create AWS Organization Structure

Sign in to the management/root account.

Go to AWS Organizations → enable if not already enabled.

Create Organizational Units:

a. Security
b. Workloads

Create accounts:

a. Security account
b. Workloads-Dev account

Move accounts into OUs:
Security → Security OU
Workloads-Dev → Workloads OU

2. **Create Central Log Bucket in Security Account**

Log into the Security account.

Go to S3 → Create bucket:

Name: org-cloudtrail-logs-<your-unique-id>

Block Public Access: ON

Versioning: optional but recommended

Enable Default Encryption:

Use a KMS CMK (create one if not present).

Under Permissions, add a bucket policy to allow CloudTrail from org:
